The decision to use a corp is mainly based the generational or area but not with scientific knowledge and market analysis. This result people using undistributed corps, which results in very low prizes for some of the popular corps and very high prizes for some other corps. This results in a bad situation for farmers and also for the consumers. No knowledge of upcoming weather situation and its effect on the corps results in losses for the farmer due to damaged fields, corps and disease.",
